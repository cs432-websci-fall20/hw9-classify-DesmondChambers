Important! The Student Opinion Surveys schedule is based on the session and course dates of the course.
In order to encourage participation in the Student Opinion Survey, Information Technology Services (ITS) is sponsoring a drawing 
for two 10.2" iPads WiFi 32GB after the end of the current semester. You will automatically be entered in the drawing once per 
course for each survey that you complete.
