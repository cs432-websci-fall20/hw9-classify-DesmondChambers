Dear Desmond,
Flu season is upon us, and we want all Monarchs to be prepared. Have you gotten your flu shot yet? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone over six months of age should receive a flu shot.
Old Dominion University is offering several free flu shot opportunities on campus where you can receive your flu shot.  You can arrive, no appointment necessary, to the following locations on the designated day to get a flu vaccine.
