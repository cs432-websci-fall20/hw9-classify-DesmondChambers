Attention Monarch Students  
Have you had the opportunity to apply what youâ€™ve learned inside the classroom to an outside active learning experience?  Some 
examples include service learning, internships, on-campus employment, practicums, research, student teaching, and clinical 
placements.   Faculty are collecting data about student experiences in these types of programs to improve the quality for current
and future Monarchs.
