Each sessions will consist of 3-4 student presentations centered around a theme of research, scholarship, or creativity. Students will submit a 250-word abstract directly to ODU Digital Commons and your listed faculty mentor. We also have a poster and oral session presenter template to follow if you prefer to use it.
Student abstracts are due by Friday, January 22, 2021. If results are not available by January, but will be by the Symposium date, please submit an abstract anyway.  
Please RSVP by March 6, 2020. The Call for Papers portal is now ready.
Since we virtual in the 2021, we are looking forward to record numbers for both attendance and presentations!
Please feel free to share this your classmates, and if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at ehill@odu.edu.
Have a great day,
