Abstract: As modern science grows in both scale and complexity, there is a need for a systematic and quantitative framework that takes into account the Scholarly Big Data. As such, the science of science has become an increasingly important topic, which turns the scientific methods upon itself, to quantify the patterns that emerge and offer the lessons that can be learned from a systematic and quantitative framework by mining the large-scale datasets. In this talk, I will first introduce the contextual background of science of science, e.g. What is the science of science? Why do we need and care about the topic? I will then discuss the latest studies on individual careers, such as the reproducible patterns underlying an individual career in science, and the fundamental mechanisms that drive the success of a career.
