It is important for you to not only take care of yourself, but also the community you are returning to over the break. ODU is offering the opportunity to take a COVID-19 test prior to your departure from campus. Test results can take up to 48 hours to receive, therefore schedule your testing time based on your anticipated departure date from campus. It is important to note a single negative test result only means that you do not have detectable COVID-19 at the time of testing or that your sample was collected too early in your infection and you could still potentially be infectious. When you return home you must continue to follow preventive measures (wearing a mask, social distancing, frequent hand hygiene to protect yourself and your family) therefore quarantining is recommended after testing to reduce risk of future exposure.
