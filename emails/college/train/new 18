Dear wonderful students, 
Do you have some exciting research or creative work from a class you want to share? Have you worked with a faculty on scholarship and want to showcase it? This includes such things as laboratory work, art exhibits, class projects, poetry, fieldwork, high-impact practices, community-engaged learning, and more!
You are in luck!
