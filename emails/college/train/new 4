Dear Monarch Community: 
I am happy to announce Dr. Don Stansberry has been named vice president for student engagement and enrollment services, following 
a national search. Dr. Stansberry will begin his appointment on Jan. 10.  
Old Dominion is fortunate to have a student-centered leader like Dr. Stansberryâ€”a practitioner, scholar and administrator who has
been instrumental in developing and implementing programs at ODU that support and challenge students to achieve personal and 
academic success. His wealth of experience has also been a tremendous asset to the University, contributing to the highest 
retention and graduation rates in its history. Over his more than 20 years of leadership and service at ODU, he has contributed to
our commitment to inclusive excellence by engaging partners in diversifying our student body and creating student success 
initiatives such as the Safe Space and ODU Cares and supporting Brother2Brother.
